# WatcherPrime

Automatically hack vulnerable webcams, IPcams, security cameras, CCTVs, doorbell cameras, etc., from all over the internet with just a few clicks. 

# How It Works
WatcherPrime automatically scans the internet for vulnerable devices and then hacks these devices using the payloads.
This program was made using python3.10, some Metasploit payloads, lots of free time and definitely too much coffee.
